          <p>Fantasy Wars is a turn-based strategy game set in a fantasy world. Players can select one of three races and battle on four different maps against another player or a computer opponent. I worked with designing the overall gameplay structure, implementing key gameplay features as well as the AI for the computer player. I also led the code-review process and the version control workflow (git/Github). Fantasy Wars was built with Javascript and the Phaser framework.</p>

          <p>This project seeks to address the problem of ordering in a restaurant. Given a desired amount of money you wish to spend, the site allows users to find a combination of items that add up to the order exactly. This is a NP-hard problem. As such, the expected runtime of the solution is exponential with the number of menu items and target price. A trade-off was made to prevent large menus or a very high target price from being loaded rather than forcing the user to wait. Performance testing was performed to prevent menus that would result in greater than a 15 second wait.</p>

You will be able to type in a couple of cards that you see an opponent play. You will then be presented with possible decks that you may be facing and will be able to narrow them down further as more cards are played. You can also browse through all the current cards and build new decks to add to your collection.</p>
