					<h1>Online Security</h1>
					<h2>What is the future of online security?</h2>
					<p>Online security is a major topic in the tech industry today. Almost everyone using the internet today is aware of the dangers of not using secure transmissions for things such as email, website passwords, or personal information. The problem is that even though many are aware of the importance of security very few people actively follow good security policies regularly and without mistakes.</p>
					<p>One of the main reasons that many people don't follow good security practices is that security is not very easy to use.  Security practices such as having a different strong, secure password for every website or using encryption when sending emails is currently very cumbersome.  Many of the security best practices feel like additional things that must be done rather than things that can automatically be done for you.</p>
					<p>I think one possible solution to some of these problems would be crowd-funded projects that deliver a usable, secure product.  For example, there could be a crowd-funded project to create a very usable password management database.  The current password management systems seem to be built to more of an IT audience and a crowd-funded project may put the emphasis back on the user.  The project could come with a USB stick that is password protected and that can be wiped remotely should you lose it.  </p>
