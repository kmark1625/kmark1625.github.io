* How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
It was a good experience working through the process of wireframing and creating the HTML of a page with a partner.  This helped me to gain a different perspective on how I would go about doing the assignment.  It helped me to see how many different plausible solutions there are to any given problem.
* Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
I found wireframing to be very helpful.  It helped me to visualize what I wanted the end result to look like along with making it a lot easier to see what HTML elements to use for each section
* What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
A good wireframe was one that clearly represented the major aspects of the web site.  All of the main components that we wanted on the page should be present on the wireframe as well as having the correct relative positions to one another.
* What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
I didn't neccessarily learn about any new elements, however, I did gain a better understand of using divs and host it can be useful to use divs to group similar bits of content.
