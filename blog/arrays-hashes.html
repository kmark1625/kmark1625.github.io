					<h1>Arrays vs Hashes</h1>
					<h2>What is the difference between the two?</h2>
					<p>Arrays are very useful for holding a collection of items in an ordered and sequential way. Hashes, on the other hand, are more useful for carrying a collection of items that can be identified by a key value. One example of a time to use an array would be to store a sequence of numbers, such as the first ten odd numbers. You might populate this array with the following code and then later use the array to quickly do calculations:</p>
					<p><pre><code>
						odds = (1..20).step(2).to_a
						sum_of_odds = odds.inject(:+)
						prod_of_odds = odds.inject(:*)
					</code></pre></p>
					<p>Hashes would be more useful for storing something like the grades for every student in the class.  You could then recall a given student by their name and return what their grade in the class is.  This could be accomplished with the following code:
					</p>
					<pre><code>
						grades = {"Boris" => 90, "Al" => 80, "Amy" => 85}
						puts grades["Boris"}
						puts grades["Amy"]
					</code></pre>
