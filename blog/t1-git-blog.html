      If you have never used version control software before, Git and GitHub may seem like more trouble than it's worth.  On top of the overhead of installing the software and configuring it appropriately, there is a whole new set of commands and workflows you must learn to even do something simple like save a version of a file.  However, once you do put forth the effort to learn Git and GitHub you will find that there are many great benefits to using this software and that you will be able to do magical things you might not have thought possible using traditional methods of storing files.

      One of the main reasons you should use version control software (such as Git) is that it allows you to have a history of changes you have made to a document.  This is known as the revision history.  If you were working on an essay using Microsoft Word, you might make many changes to the essay over the life of the document.  Traditionally there wouldn't be an easy way to go to a specific version of the document, say that first draft that you had worked on about a year ago.  You would have to do something like save the file with a different name for each draft or take a backup of the file.  With Git, you can simply look at the revision history and go back to the version in question.  You can even "tag" important versions of a file so you can quickly refer back to them.

      GitHub gives you many of the same benefits of Git, except also allows you to collaborate on a larger scale.  This allows you to share your code with other people as well as keep a history of updates to the code.  This can allow others to even make updates to the code and send them to you for suggested improvements!
