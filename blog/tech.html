					<h1>SVG</h1>
					<h2>What is SVG and why should you consider using it?</h2>
					<p>SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. This is a file format that allows images and graphics to be displayed in an XML format on the web. SVG files end with a .svg extension. Typically, you might use a PNG, JPG, or GIF to display an image or graphic. SVG offers a couple of special features which you should consider as a reason for using it as an alternative.</p>
					<p>SVG is resolution independent, meaning that you can use a single file to display for any scale or resolution. If using other formats, you might need a seperate image for each resolution. On top of that, SVG allows you to build basic properties and advanced features into the file (such as scripting or animation). This would typically be done with CSS and would result in longer load times and more requests to the server.
					</p>
					<p>One of the main reasons SVG hasn't had widespread use is that many people don't know about its benefits or how to use it. SVG is an XML format so it may appear more complicated than PNG. Common graphics software, such as Photoshop, now has the ability to export images in SVG format. Also, some browsers may not support all of the latest features of SVG so it is important to use tools such as modernizr to ensure that a given feature is present before you try to use it.
