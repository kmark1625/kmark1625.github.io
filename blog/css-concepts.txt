* What does it mean to display inline vs using inline blocl?

The display property can be used to control the layout of elements on a page.  Each element has a default display value which is typically block or inline.  

Block elements start on a new line and take up the full width available.  Some block elements are <div>, <h1>-<h6>, <p>, <form>, <header>, <footer>, <section>.

Inline elements do not start on a new line and take up as much space as is available.  Examples of inline elements are <span>, <a>, <img>.

Display none is used to hide an element - typically used with JavaScript to hide elements under certain conditions.

The default display values can be overridden.  This only affects the display value of the item and not the element kind.  

inline-block elements allow elements to sit to their right and left and respect top and bottom margins and respect height and width.
