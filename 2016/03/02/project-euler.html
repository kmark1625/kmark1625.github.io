      <p>I set out with the goal of solving as many problems of Project Euler as I could in 3 months. Below is a set of lessons that I learned along the way from each set of problems. I decided to approach the problems sequentially and would not move on from a given set until all problems in that set were completed. I had to learn about numerous topics in coding and mathematics in order to complete the challenge. I hope this article will be helpful for a reader who is seeking to attempt a similar challenge for themselves or just a reader who is curious what the journey is like.</p>

<h2 id="math">Math</h2>

<p>There are some fundamental mathematical concepts that are required in order to solve the first set of problems. Prime numbers and factors occur over and over again throughout the first set of problems. Other math concepts that come up are usually explained in enough detail in the problem statement to get by.</p>

<h3 id="prime-numbers">Prime Numbers</h3>

<p>Explanation of prime numbers.</p>

<h3 id="factors">Factors</h3>

<p>Explanation of factors.</p>

<h3 id="test-driven-development">Test Driven Development</h3>

<p>I found test driven development to be essential in order to determine if an answer was correct.</p>

<h3 id="itertools-and-generator-functions">Itertools and Generator Functions</h3>

<p>Example from itertools and generator functions.</p>

<h3 id="object-oriented-approach">Object-Oriented Approach</h3>

<p>I found some problems lent themselves to solving with an object-oriented approach</p>
