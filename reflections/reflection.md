* What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
  * I learned a lot more about how padding, borders, and margins behave and interact with each other.  In doing this challenge I spent a lot of time trying to arrange my divs in a certain way and this process helped me understand the various interactions between elements and their margins/padding.   
* What did you learn about CSS positioning?
  * I learned that CSS positioning is an artform.  It took me quite a while to figure out how to get the various sections of my page displayed the way I want them to.  I haven't even had a change to test them on a wide variety of platforms and ensure that they display the way I want them to across all devices.
* WHat aspects of your design did you find easier to implement? What was the most difficult?
  * I found the heading and footer of the page was the easiest to implement.  I struggled implementing the actual content areas of the page and getting them to display appropriately.
* What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge? 
  * I learned that absolute positioning is very useful in getting your page to display exactly the way you want it to, however, this method does not scale well to other devices.  I'll have to practice a lot in order to work well with relative positioning in order to get my pages to display well on all devices.
