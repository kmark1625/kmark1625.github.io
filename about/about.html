					<h1>About me!</h1>
					<p>I went to the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign for a Bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering. After college, I worked at the software company Epic Systems as technical support. I realized that I really enjoyed the coding aspects of my job and am interested in pursuing a full-time development position. From my days in technical support, I still love approaching new problems and teaching others to solve them!</p>
